Route for Eternal Ordeal% on CP
Goal: Get 57 kills in Eternal Ordeal from a fresh file

Note: This route takes advantage of using Flukenest to kill dupe in Eternal Ordeal. This will make one kill on a Zoteling count for multiple. To do this, you want to bring the enemies health down to 4 or less, and then hit it with multiple flukes simultaneously. This is a major glitch, but this run would be very unfun without this glitch.

*My strats for kill duping*
Turret Zotelings are the easiest to kill dupe, so we want to get them to start spawning as quickly as possible.
They will start spawning when the counter is above 15, however if we kill dupe to have the counter jump from less than 15 to over 20, they will never spawn for the rest of the attempt.

Therefore, we want to get the counter to 3 or 4 before kill duping a normal Zoteling. This is preferred to doing the attempt normally until 15 because it will prevent fat Zotelings from spawning for the whole attempt and it's faster.

A very consistent method of kill duping a regular Zoteling is to stand under it as it falls into the arena with inventory open. As soon as you get hit, cast 1 Shade Soul with Flukenest. Then you want to count out exactly 11 nail hits. Finally, inventory knockback cancel as it runs towards you with its sword, casting flukes right after it hits you. I like to set up the very first Zoteling that spawns before killing flying and frog Zotelings to get up to 3 or 4.

To kill dupe on the turrets, you want to get exactly 6 nail hits and 2 full casts of flukes. Once the turrets start spawning, you should heavily focus them, since killing one will almost always spawn another. 3 successful dupes on turrets will get you above 57 on the counter.
