# Elegy% NMG [No Shamans Rereoute] - 1.2.2.1 and 1.4.3.2+

1221 and LP have different geo values, mostly due to lever skipping past certain enemies. To make up for this:
- 1221 - Grabs Sanctum chest, geo is rarely an issue
- LP - Skips chest but gets a rock in edge (if necessary) and focuses on getting geo in arenas

Isma’s Tear: Picking up Isma’s is optional, but it’s a bit slower. There is no difference in the route whether you pick it up or not, so if the route says “acid skip” just do it with Isma’s.
