A Note On Pantheons
	Default build is 7 notches, Shaman + Twister + Heart, Nail 3. Given our lack of Shriek, this is notably more starved than Godhome Ending (although admittedly you're only going through P2). Some other alternatives include skipping the FC notch and Heart in favor of buying Strength early; you can make up Geo difference with Rafters seal (you may need a pre-Sanctum Lemm trip to make sure you can afford Elegant Key), or just skip both and rock Shaman + Twister 5 masks (or get def crest or something idk)
