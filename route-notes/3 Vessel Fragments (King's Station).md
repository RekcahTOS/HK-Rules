# 3 Vessel Fragments King's Station route
(for any patch, though it's optimal on 1.4+)

Note: This route is slower than the Stag Nest route by ~20 seconds, but it skips having to the precise Vengefly pogo up to Stag Nest
Another note: Just run this on 1.4+; it's faster because you have to kill Moss Knights on 1.2.2.1 and even then you might be a bit under and have to kill some more City enemies

[Geo]

## King's Station Fragment
- Head to Gruz Mother normally
- Open the Crossroads stag [390] and bench

- Rescue Sly, do not bench at Salubra or buy Shaman Stone
- Shade skip, respawning at Crossroads stag instead of Salubra (hit the bell while you're there)
- Head to the arena above King's Station (no Dream Nail)

up all of the arena geo)
