[Geo]
{Essence}


False Knight
•Optionally grab Fury of the Fallen (if want to overcharm Fury + Strength later?)
•I guess get some geo rocks? It has to be worth it (underneath well, before Aspid arena, near the entrance to Fungal Wastes, in first Goam room)
•Bench in the Crossroads stag
•Kill Gruz Mother, rescue Sly, and S&Q to the stag
•Head to False Knight, killing the Husk Guard along the way
•Kill False Knight, grab the geo chest, and S&Q to the stag
 
Dreamshield
•Open the Crossroads stag
•Start geo grinding — kill the Aspids by the wall grub (you sadly cannot free the grub or only one Aspid will respawn), kill the Husk Guard in the next room, then S&Q after collecting the geo
•Repeat until you have ~1886 geo [1886] (it's okay if you're a tiny bit under; also, free the grub on the last trip or else)

•Collect Dream Nail

Mothwing Cloak

•Bench at the waterfall bench (optionally unequip Dreamshield to not mess with Squit skip and Moss Chargers)

Note: There are variants of the Dreamshield route that shade skip to Resting Grounds instead of grinding geo for Lantern, but since the point of this route is to avoid the stupid trick and to not do a different one instead, I'm ignoring them.
