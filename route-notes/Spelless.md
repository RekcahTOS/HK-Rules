- Fight Shrumal Ogres, grab the charm notch [690]
- Bench at Leg Eater and buy Fragile Strength (don't equip) [0]
- Any% movement to Claw [10], S+Q to Leg Eater bench

## Dream Nail
- Walk up out of Fungal to Crossroads
- Bench at Salubra and set up the any% (claw + dash) shade skip to blue lake
- Only after you die can you equip strength, don't make the same mistakes quack does all the time
- Ordinary any% movement to Dream Nail

## Nail Upgrade / Watcher Knights
- Descend to right City of Tears like in any%
- Pick up the any% journal [40]
- Grab the relic above King's station
- Kill Gorgeous Husk [490]
- Bench in spire

- Cash out at Lemm [1865]
- Upgrade to Nail 1 [1615], S+Q to spire
- Break the chandelier and fight Watcher Knights

## Lantern
- Absorb Lurien
- Get the WK chest [2270] -- from this point on your geo is identical to any%, so ideally you have 2322 at this point from incidental geo. Can make it up with city enemies if really hurting.
- Head back to King's Station and open it [1970], stag to Dirtmouth and bunch
- Buy Lumafly Lantern [170]

## Crystal Heart/Uumuu
- Get Crystal heart with exactly identical movement to any% NMG [120]
- S+Q to Dirtmouth, head to Archives exactly as any% NMG
- For Uumuu; optimal pattern is a 3-cycle without Fury and a 2-cycle if you're crazy. Most success was found with a konami-code-esque attack pattern against it (2 upslashes, two pogos, then work nail hits in wherever Uumuu ends up). 8 hits per cycle is what you're aiming for.

## Herrah
- Absorb Monomon and leave Archives.
- Head down to Fungal Wastes through Queen's Station
- Pick up Spore Shroom
- Enter Deepnest; bench at hot springs and equip Spore Shroom.
- Ordinary any% deepnest route, killing both devouts and absorbing Herrah. [200] You hard need 250 geo at this point, if you're still low use geo rocks in Beast's Den to cover. In practice, this shouldn't be an issue.

## The Hollow Knight
- Exit Beast's Den, getting geo if necessary.
- Open Distant Village stag [0] and stag to Dirtmouth
- Spam Spore Shroom heals against THK until he dies. (Spore Shroom deals roughly quadruple damage to THK AND deals full damage through self stabs so it is your primary damage source)
