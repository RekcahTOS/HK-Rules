# All Geo Rocks

Category rules: Break each distinct geo rock at least once (some rocks can be broken multiple times; those don't count).

MOD: https://github.com/flibber-hk/HollowKnight.Kronk/releases/
Also run with warp-only benchwarp

Square Brackets denote number of rocks broken by the end of the instruction.

Notes on geo routing:

The important geo expenditures are:
- 2120 for Shaman + Xroads stag + Lantern + Cpeaks toll
- 750 for King's Stag Basin toll bench + Hidden Station Stag

Much of the time, it's faster to skip rock geo. Just try to stay in line with the guidelines, which should keep you on the optimal geo collection path.

The biggest geo breakpoint on this route is peaks toll/kings station. Everything after is free.

You can also opt to skip ddark+cyclone and get wraiths instead, this is probably a few seconds faster with perfect soul routing but significantly harder and probably not really worth in reality.
