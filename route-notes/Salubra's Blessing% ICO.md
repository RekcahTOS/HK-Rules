# Salubra's Blessing% Intended Charm Order route (for any 1.2+ patch, assumes 1.4+)

Note: The "intended" charm order is the order in which the charms are numbered in the game's code.
Another note: You can equip literally whatever charms you want throughout the entire run; the charms I write are less suggestions and more... random thoughts
