## Notes
\* I never timed this, but I'm pretty sure it's faster to get the upper GPath grub on your second pass even if it's a bit of backtracking? It could be correct to get this grub on your first walk through greenpath and just come back for hunter/cornifer unless Cliffs grub ends up being faster than another grub in the route.

\*\* It is theoretically possible to have enough incidental geo to make it to 7050 with only the gift seals from Seer and Grubs. However, if you do need additional geo, Peaks idol is fastest for sure and also makes it so you only ever need to sell two relics. I think it's a good safety to grab always since the incidental geo never quite made it there for me.
