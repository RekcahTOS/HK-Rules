- Gorgeous Husk {590}
- Rafters seal (ideally with the aid of Myla% rafters skips)
- Lemm {2090}, S+Q to King's Station -- need at least 60 incidental geo by this point, if you're consistently starved get Fungal rocks
    - (if you have 2200+ geo after Lemm that's not bad, it cuts out hopper farm later)

## Crystal Heart / Mimic 4
- Open King's Station Stag {1850}
- Stag to Dirtmouth and buy Lantern {50}
- Stag to Xroads, enter Peaks {0}
- Crystal Heart
- Backtrack through CPeaks to mimic room, 4th mimic

## Mimic 5
- S+Q to King's Station, out to KE
- ACN (claw + cdash) acid skip to upper Edge
- Farm whatever hoppers you need for 100 geo
- Colo 1
- Colo 2 up until the 5th mimic (about halfway)

## Additional Notes from Slaurent:
Soul Catcher Route - Slower but More Comfy for Colo 2:
- Get Soul Catcher
- During claw, get Shrumal Ogres Notch (+90 - cuts out hopper farming)
- Switch to Shaman after purchasing
- After colo1, you have 5 notches - save/quit to equip Soul Catcher.
    - Your bench is set to colo on colo1 entry, so benching prior is not needed
