# Any% Isma Route
(notes from AlejsXY, dashmaster edits by DisneyReject)

- Head through King's Pass as usual
- Aspid arena(8-15 geo)
- Head up to False Knight, grab ~8 geo off the husks and break out of the arena
- Collect VS, head through mound(50 geo from the baldur)
- Enter gpath(another 50 off the second baldur)
- Mossknight arena(40 geo)
- Skip the Vengefly King fight
- Collect geo from the moss charger if you have less than 158
- Kill Hornet and pickup Mothwing Cloak, save and quit to mound bench
- Head through the fungal wastes as usual
- Kill the mantis guarding the claw lever (6 geo on average)
- Get Mantis Claw and head to dashmaster. You need 170 geo here ideally. If not, you can kill the tall mantis outside of village with fireball dash fslash (max 12). Pick up dashmaster and quit out.
- Equip dashmaster and head to Gruz Mother(DO NOT buy Crossroads Stag).
- Kill Gruz Mother(50 geo), purchase Shaman Stone, bench and overcharm shamans and die in 3 hits(no saving Sly either).
- Skip up to Blue Lake
- Collect the Dreamnail
- Take the elevator to the City of Tears
- Do not kill any enemies or collect relics, rush straight to spire bench(bench). You usually want 8 soul entering spire bench.
- Kill the Great Husk Sentry guarding the watchers lever. Exit spire and head to Ancient Basin.
- Make your way past the spike pit and stallball up (you usually enter with 5-7 soul, so you can retry if you miss).
- Kill the Broken Vessel (should enter fight with 6-9 soul) and collect Monarch Wings, quit out to spire bench. Can heal twice before fight starts if necessary.
- Make your way up to the Watcher Knight's arena
- Break the chandelier (collect incidental soul on the way to chandelier)
- Kill Watcher Knights and get Lurien
- On your way down from Lurien get the watcher rewards chest, you need at least 507 geo at this point, seeing how barely any incidental geo remains in the run (43 from devout and maybe some in petras arena). This means you don't need all of the chest geo (655) though.
- Head down and right, buy the King's Station Stag and bench (try to be at full soul to do toll fireball).
- Head back down the broken elevator, collecting 3 soul from the husks in the long room, but this time spike tunnel into Isma's Grove
- Do your favorite variant of hwurmp shenanigans into the next room
- Stallball across the acid and collect Isma's Tear
- Quit out to King's Station, Stag to Dirthmouth and head down to archives
-  Acid swim into Fog Canyon, enter the archives
- Kill Uumuu and get Monomon
- Climb out of archives and acid swim into the Queen's Gardens
- Defeat the petra arena and hit the lever(this is current patch no thorn skip)
- Head down and left, fall into Deepnest
- Make your way through darknest into Distant Village
- Skip Beast's Den and get Herrah. Bear in mind you want a damage tank for the devout and you're overcharmed, so you want to take at most 1 hit between monomon and devout.
- Buy the Distant Village Stag and head back to Dirtmouth
- Enter the Black Egg Temple. Bench and remove dashmaster because it's more consistent and doesn't lose too much time. Kill THK, win at video game.
