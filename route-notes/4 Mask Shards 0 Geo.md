# 4MS 0 Geo
Goal: Collect an extra mask without picking up any geo.
Routing by Glitchiness

## First Mask Shard
- Go through King's Pass and into Crossroads.
- Get the pogo/dash grub to the right of the gruzzer room.
- Clear Aspid Arena (double spike is still possible 0 geo but be careful with killing aspids too far right)
- Get the Goam mask shard as in 4ms.

## Vengeful Spirit
- Continue right from the Goam shard; bench at Xroads stag.
- Free the grub behind the false wall, continue up.
- Free the grub in right crossroads by the tram, behind the spike pogo. S+Q to Xroads bench.
- Go to False Knight. Lure the enemies to the right side of the arena before triggering the fight. Hope that FK doesn't jump too far backwards.
- Grab Vengeful Spirit.

## Second Mask Shard
- Go through Mound. S+Q after killing the Baldur to respawn at Snail Shaman and not pick up geo.
- Exit Mound to the left and return to the gruzzer room.
- Go kill Brooding Mawlek for another shard.

## Third Mask Shard
- Enter Greenpath (leave and return to the room after killing the baldur to despawn geo).
- Proceed down (gasp) the intended path, freeing the Cornifer grub.
- Free the grub below the Hunter.
- Head to the back of Stone Sanctuary and pick up a shard. S+Q to Mound.

## Fourth Mask Shard
- Leave mound to the left and climb up the gruzzer room.
- Head to Grubfather. Stand on the far left of the room to avoid collecting geo as it's chucked around.
- Grab the final mask shard. (It's okay to land on geo, the mask shard autosplits while you're in the air)
