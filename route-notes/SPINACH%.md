Routing by Eisog and vichisuki

Testing by ins0mnia, Quatopine and Psyklone

Last updated: 5/09/24
- rerouted wings to be after dung defender
- modified earlygame geo
- nail 0 colosseums
- changed endgame shopping route

Goal:
- S - Spells (Vengeful Spirit, Shade Soul, Desolate Dive, Descending Dark, Howling Wraiths, Abyss Shriek)
- P - Pins (Tram Pass, Dream Nail)
- I - Idols (requires 38 grubs, 200 essence)
- N - Nail (requires 6 pale ore, including 31 grubs, 300 essence, NOT awoken dream nail because it's just one Nail)
- A - All
- C - Charm
- H - Hnotches (25 charms, 11 notches)

RULES:
- Collect all base and void spells: (Vengeful Spirit, Shade Soul, Desolate Dive, Descending Dark, Howling Wraiths, Abyss Shriek)
- Buy all Map Pins from Iselda: These are the the map pins that are relevant to the bingo goal. They can be found on the wiki under "Map Pins", but specifically we do not need the markers, as "markers" doesn't have a P in it. This requires Tram Pass and Dream Nail.
- Collect all King's Idols: There are 8 King's Idols in the game as of Godmaster. You do not need to have all of them at the same time, you are allowed to sell them, you just need to have picked all of them up.
- Upgrade your nail to the highest level: This requires 6 Pale Ore.
- Obtain all 11 charm notches: This requires 25 charms.
- Definition by vichisuki

DISCLAIMER:
This category could theoretically end with All Charms, Hornets (for Hornet Defender and Hornet Sentinel) however, this requires both Kingsoul, Collector (for Elegy) and just generally ends up being a slightly longer salubra's blessing. Hnotches is much funnier. If you have qualms about this you can fight me personally.

thank you to blossom for inventing the name of this category :) this is a pretty silly representation of it by me but we'll run it
note: you must go through city storerooms simple key room at least once during this run. this is a requirement by @BlossomTheCellist

# Notes
Reasoning for various choices:

We don't really want to get fragile charms because we already have to spend a lot of money in this run. Therefore, we need to get 3 extra charms instead of the fragiles. Therefore, we get:
- Weaversong: We're in darknest for the grub regardless, so we might as well stop off, plus we have wings
- Grubsong: We have to get the pale ore and idol and money, so we might as well grab this for free.
- Flukenest: saves time, as we are in Waterways anyway, and it saves time on Dung Defender + Nosk

We can also skip a total of 8 grubs. We don't want to get collector grubs (3/8) nor do we want to get the QG Grubs (6/8) leaving us with two extra skips.
The most isolated grubs are:
- Quick Slash Grub
- DV Grub
Therefore we need ALL OTHER GRUBS, unfortunately including Hive main grub. This is still faster than Oro dive grub since we pass by several times anyway.
