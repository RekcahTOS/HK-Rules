Notes:
If you wish to avoid joni's darkroom while learning this route, after shade cloak, Pick up Abyss egg, then head up to KS. Get KS relic and bench, kill GH and pick up Rafters relic on the way to lemm. Sell, and S+Q to KS. Continue through GP to MMC and through QG, and stag to dirtmouth for lantern, key and gravedigger after quitting out after TL, before jonis.

Cutting Lantern saves pretty much ALL of the econ time, but commits you to dark Joni's Blessing with dash/claw only
