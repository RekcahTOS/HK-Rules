107% All Bosses Route (June 2024 Reroute)
Compared to the comsob splits on splitmaker, this route gets waterways shard before flukenest as we don't OC that segment. Swap them either in the route or the splits based on what you want to do. 
This route doesn't do some of the harder overcharms, but does a lot of the easy / fast / important ones.
