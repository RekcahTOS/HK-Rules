# Al2ba% route (for 1.4+)


## Vengeful Spirit
- Head through Crossroads like normal
- Skip False Knight
- Collect Vengeful Spirit
- Soul Catcher is probably not worth it but is comfy for QG

## A1uba
- Head through Greenpath like normal
- Fight Hornet and collect Mothwing Cloak (save a cast of soul)
- Activate the Dreamer cutscene and head to the Lake of Unn
- Kill the first Aluba (dash properly through the room, then jump -> dash -> pogo the Moss Knight -> dash -> fireball -> S&Q after the fireball hits the Aluba)
- S&Q to Ancestral Mound

## Mantis Claw
- Head through Fungal Wastes like normal
- Pick up Mantis Claw

## Deepnest
- Head to the drop entrance to Deepnest
- Pick up Spore Shroom
- Head through Deepnest to the hot spring (bench and equip Spore Shroom)
- Head through dark Deepnest (including the reverse Mask Maker room) up into Queen's Gardens

## Al2ba
- Optionally bench at the toll bench for safety
- Fight the upper QG arena
- Head through the frog rooms up to the other side of the wall from the White Lady
- Rescue the grub
- Stand at the top (at the place where your camera moves to the right) and wait for the Aluba to come close
- Heal and hope that Spore Shroom kills it
- If your Spore Shroom was timed right but the Aluba didn't die from it, you have to completely exit and re-enter the room to reset the Aluba RNG (how far left it goes is completely random)
- Done, you have to manually end the timer
