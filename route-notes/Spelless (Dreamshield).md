Spelless Dreamshield route (for 1.4.3.2, because Spore Shroom THK)

Note: This route is slow af

[Geo]


False Knight
•Optionally grab Fury of the Fallen (if you're crazy and want to overcharm Fury + Strength later)
•I guess get some geo rocks? It has to be worth it (underneath well, before Aspid arena, near the entrance to Fungal Wastes, in first Goam room)
•Bench in the Crossroads stag
•Kill Gruz Mother, rescue Sly, and S&Q to the stag
•Head to False Knight, killing the Husk Guard along the way
•Kill False Knight, grab the geo chest, and S&Q to the stag

Dreamshield
•Open the Crossroads stag
•Start geo grinding — kill the Aspids by the wall grub (you sadly cannot free the grub or only one Aspid will respawn), kill the Husk Guard in the next room, then S&Q after collecting the geo
•Repeat until you have ~1886 geo [1886] (it's okay if you're a tiny bit under; also, free the grub on the last trip or else)
•Stag to Dirtmouth (bench) and buy Lumafly Lantern [86]
•Stag to Crossroads
•Enter Crystal Peak through the dark room [36] and head through it to Resting Grounds
•Collect Dream Nail
•Grab Dreamshield and S&Q to Dirtmouth

Mothwing Cloak
•Drop down the well and head to the Baldur
•Kill it using Dreamshield — stand at the exact distance it closes at, then quickly move right and left and press nail when Dreamshield is around 10 o'clock (I posted a video in #misc if you want to see what that looks like) [86]
•Bench at the waterfall bench (optionally unequip Dreamshield to not mess with Squit skip and Moss Chargers)
•Do squit skip (and optionally dudepogo)
•Get the Moss Knights and geo rocks [296] (advice: don't try to fight both Moss Knights at the same time)
•Fight Hornet and collect Mothwing Cloak
•S&Q to the waterfall bench

Mantis Claw
•Unequip Dreamshield (unless you want Fog Canyon to be mega cursed)
•Drop down to lower Greenpath
•Kill MMC [596] — if you don't have 596 geo, get the nearby geo rock
•Head down through Fog Canyon to Fungal Wastes
•Kill the Shrumal Ogres [686] and collect the charm notch
•Head up to Leg Eater and bench
•Buy Fragile Strength [0] (don't equip it, unless you're fine with a slightly more cursed Mantis pogo)
•Head to Mantis Village
•Optionally do a cursed epogo
•Collect Mantis Claw
•S&Q to Leg Eater (equip Strength)

Crystal Heart
•Walk back up into Crossroads
•Bench in the Crossroads stag and head up to the Lantern entrance to Crystal Peak
•Head through Crystal Peak
•Collect Crystal Heart
•S&Q to the Crossroads stag

Lurien
•Head towards Salubra
•Cdash across Blue Lake
•Head down the elevator to King's Station
•Bench in King's Station
•Kill Gorgeous Husk [~450]
•Head past the fountain to Nailsmith (probably faster than benching in Spire and going above the fountain because you have cdash)
•Upgrade to Nail 1 [200] and S&Q to King's Station (it also might be faster to skip the bench and just cdash from the Nailsmith back to Spire?)
•Head through Spire to the Watcher Knights [300]
•Kill the Watcher Knights
•Absorb Lurien and grab the geo chest [more than enough for the rest of the run]

Monomon
•Head back to King's Station
•Stag to Dirtmouth
•Head down the well into Crossroads
•Acid skip into Fog Canyon
•Kill Uumuu and absorb Monomon

Herrah
•Exit Archives and head through Queen's Station to Fungal Wastes
•Grab Spore Shroom and drop into Deepnest
•Equip Spore Shroom at the hot spring bench
•Head to Distant Village
•Sit at the Beast's Den trap bench, head through Beast's Den, and absorb Herrah

The Hollow Knight
•Stag to Dirtmouth
•Head to the Temple of the Black Egg
•Kill the Hollow Knight using Spore Shroom
•Done


Note: There's a slightly slower yet infinitely cooler alternative route that does this:
•Grind three more rotations of geo (to 2058 total; you might be able to get away with skipping one if you get some of the geo rocks in Beast's Den)
•Skip Leg Eater bench (make sure to still buy Fragile Strength though)
•After Mantis Claw, head to Spore Shroom instead of S&Qing
•Equip Fragile Strength and Spore Shroom at the hot spring bench
•Head to Distant Village (not in the dark because you have Lantern)
•Head through Beast's Den and absorb Herrah (if you don't have 250 geo, break some of the geo rocks to the right of Herrah or in the alcove to the left and down)
•Stag from Distant Village to Crossroads and head to Peak
•Continue the same from there
•After Monomon, stag from Queen's Station to Dirtmouth and head to the Temple of the Black Egg

Another note: There are variants of the Dreamshield route that buy either Longnail or complete a 6th mask to shade skip to Resting Grounds instead of grinding geo for Lantern, but since the point of this route is to avoid the stupid trick and to not do a different one instead, I'm ignoring them.
