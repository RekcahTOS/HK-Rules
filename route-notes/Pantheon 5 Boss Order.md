oof

General geo route: get whatever non-journal relics you pass by in the early game; and then sell to lemm and enjoy being over for basically the rest of the game
you do colo 2 so early and there's basically nothing you have to buy after lantern idk go buy shop charms to make 69% completion if you really want to

mask shards we can get include: no eyes, cg2, 1500E, bretta, fungal core, qs shard, mawlek, one from sly? Can buy from Sly or get Bretta shard earlier or later depending on when you want 6 masks or the heal

Alternate Herrah/Brumm route:
Bench at QS on the way down from Uumuu, don't bench in hot springs before Nosk, s+q back and stag out to KS for Hornet 2

Instead, drop a dreamgate by QG stag when you stag out for Traitor Lord and do Brumm/Herrah then (80% sure this is just slower)
