# HK video submission guidelines

The patch must be clearly readable for at least 1 frame. The top-left corner must be visible to verify the assembly used. If the patch is not readable, timestamp a different title screen where it is readable.

The essence counter must be visible when present.

All masks in the UI must always be visible. If you gain extra masks, including Lifeblood masks, these must also be unobscured.

Try not to cover too much of the screen with overlay elements - runs may be rejected if the knight is covered for significant portions of gameplay. You can mitigate this by using a chroma key filter, making Livesplit smaller, or changing your OBS scene so Livesplit doesn't cover the game at all.

Make sure the loadless timer remains clearly readable.
