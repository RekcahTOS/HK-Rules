Any glitch that is not listed here should be considered banned until you have clarified its status with the mods.  
In addition, any newly discovered glitch should also be considered banned until its status is decided.

Please direct questions to us on the [Hollow Knight Speedrun Community Discord](https://discord.gg/3JtHPsBjHD).

## Allowed Glitches:
- Any glitch that is performed accidentally and provides no benefit to the runner.

- Wallcling storage (WCS) on patches before 1.3, so long as non-WCS NMG movement through the same space with current items and room state is available to the player.
	- If the non-WCS access requires permanent changes: these must be made prior to using WCS. An example would be if the non-WCS access requires breaking a breakable floor.
	- If the non-WCS access requires enemies or objects to be in a certain state: they must be in that state or be able to be put in that state without reentering the room.
	- Same space is defined topologically, meaning that two paths are in the same space if one can be dragged to the other in space without passing through any platforms or barriers.

- Airwalk obtained from dashing over a seam is allowed provided it meets the same criteria as used above for the wallcling storage rule. Jumping out of the airwalk is never allowed, however accidental uses of it may be allowed at verifier discretion.

- Early control, as long as it does not result in major glitches such as text storage or invisibility. The following means of early control are generally legal:
	- Gaining early control by pausing and unpausing, as long as it doesn't result in a major glitch like text storage
	- Leaving seer's room early after acquiring Dream Nail (even though this technically results in invisibility behind the white screen)
	- Gaining early control by hitting a hazard with inventory open
		- This includes early control at Isma’s Tear via jumping into acid before picking up the item
	- Gaining early control by using a hazard to skip roar animations
		- This includes early control at the Soul Master fight via jumping into the spikes on the right side of the room
	- Gaining early control by taking damage from an enemy
		- This includes early control for the City of Tears fountain cutscene
		- This includes skipping boss roars via intentional damage (e.g. on The Hollow Knight, The Collector, etc)
	- Note: in many early control states, it is easy to accidentally perform major glitches such as focus storage, certain forms of float, or text storage. It is the runner’s responsibility to ensure this does not happen, and runs which do perform major glitches risk invalidation. Runners should be careful to avoid gaining control with inventory open, while at a bench, during any kind of load, or while casting spells

- Inventory storage, in cases where it is clearly accidental and no benefit is gained e.g. when falling into Deepnest near Spore Shroom.

- White screen glitch, as long as the runner performs a save & quit to fix the glitch without achieving any in-game goals relevant to the category being run.

- Skipping pick-up animations by quitting to the main menu, as long as pausing during the pick-up does not involve the use of a glitch.

- Opening inventory in midair to drop faster and cancel the landing animation.

- Falling off a ledge shortly after landing on it in order to cancel the landing animation.

- Using Dream Nail to gain early control while collecting the Essence from Dream Warriors.

- Killing Elder Baldurs instantly by hitting them from offscreen.

- Abusing incorrect hazard respawn locations e.g. the hazard warp below the first arena in Queen's Gardens.

- Causing tolls to activate early by looking down, turning around or using focus.

- Hitting levers, grubs or other interactable objects through walls e.g. the lever skip in the Watcher's Spire.

- Storing Dash Slash casts with inventory.

- Maintaining Fury of the Fallen buff despite not being at 1HP by picking up a charm notch.

- Gaining control during the Dreamgate animation is allowed as long as the Dreamgate animation completes and no other glitches result.

## Banned Glitches:
- Any glitch which results in invulnerability.

- Any glitch which results in the character becoming invisible or will result in an invisible character with no additional player input.

- Any glitch which allows the player to get Out of Bounds.

- Any glitch using Main Menu Storage.

- Any glitch which breaks Boss AI such that they are severely limited from moving or attacking.
	- Hornet 1 getting stuck in the ground in overworld does not invalidate the run as long as she can still move and attack
	- Hornet 2 getting stuck in the ground in overworld does not invalidate the run
	- Hornet getting stuck in the ground during pantheon IL invalidates the run if she fails to jump at least 3 times
	- Hornet getting stuck in the ground in pantheons is still subject to a 5 seconds penalty, but only if she fails to jump at least 3 times

- Wallcling storage on patches 1.3.1.5 and later.

- Wallcling storage, in any case not explicitly allowed above.

- Wallcling slides (where the knight achieves superslide speed using nail recoil during wallcling storage).

- Unclinged wallcling storage (where the knight collides with a curved surface during WCS, losing the wallcling animation while keeping the ability to continuously dash midair).

- Airwalk obtained via means other than dashing over a seam, including turning around on corners and seams or out of an airstall, if performed on purpose or if any benefit is gained from using it.
  - Illegal benefit includes using airwalk to maintain walking speed when faster than ordinary movement (e.g. Sprintmaster equipped).

- Chaining jumps from airwalk, if performed on purpose or if any benefit is gained from using it.

- Seam Jumps (a glitch introduced in the 1.5 version of the game, allowing players to jump off of the seams in vertical walls without Mantis Claw) are banned, except when clearly 
accidental and of no significant benefit.

- Clipping underwater, or gaining nonswim movement in water or acid.

- Text Storage (e.g. before Hornet 1).

- Inventory storage, if performed on purpose or if any benefit is gained from using it.

- Float glitch, if performed on purpose or if any benefit is gained from using it.

- Dying with inventory open to regain control.

- Quick Map storage.

- Focus storage.

- Superdash storage.

- Unovercharm glitch.

- Charm notch duping.

- Item duping.

- Room duping.

- Duping enemy kills with Flukenest.

- Superslides.

- Thorn warps.

- Hazard warps achieved by gaining early control on a room transition.

- Televator.

- Maintaining Fury of the Fallen buff despite not being at 1HP by leaving a dream at 1HP with Dreamgate.

## Penalties
A banned glitch which saves under 1 second with no other benefits, at verifier's discretion, may receive a 2 second penalty instead of rejection. Benefits which lead to rejection include but are not limited to:
  - Any advantage gained during a boss fight.
  - Any advantage which bypasses or trivializes technical movement.
  - Any advantage in soul, hp, or geo beyond what could be acquired in 1 second otherwise.
