    ## **Banned Glitches**

    - Any Invulnerability glitch
    - Any Out of Bounds glitch
    - Any glitch that results in an invisible character or will result in a invisible character with no additional player input
    - Any form of item duplication
    - Inventory Storage
    - Float glitch
    - Superslides
    - Breaking Boss AI such that they are severely limited from moving or attacking. Hornet getting stuck in the ground after the stagger is an exempt from this rule as long as she's otherwise able to move and attack.

    Some use of glitches may be ignored if usage is both clearly accidental and not beneficial to the runner.

    **[More detailed rules can be found in the Rules document.](https://github.com/hk-speedrunning/HK-Rules/blob/main/nmg-rules.md)**

    If there is something not listed here that seems like a major glitch, please ask in the discord before using it in runs.
